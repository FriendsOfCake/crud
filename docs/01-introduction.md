# Introduction

The `Crud` plugin allows high reusability of the default Create (`add` action), Retrieve (`index` and `view` action), Update (`edit` action) and Delete (`delete` action`) (CRUD) in your controllers

The code for CRUD is usually very simple, and always looks the same - this plugin will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to re-implement them over and over

It only works with CakePHP > 2.1 - as it utilizes the new event system
