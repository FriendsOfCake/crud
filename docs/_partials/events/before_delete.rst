Crud.beforeDelete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This event is emitted before calling ``Table::delete``.

The :ref:`Crud Subject <crud-subject>` contains the following keys:

- **id** The ID of the entity, from the URL
- **item** The ``Entity`` from the ``find()`` call.

To abort a ``delete()`` simply stop the event by calling
``$event->stopPropagation()``.

Stop Delete
-----------

.. code-block:: phpinline

	public function delete($id) {
		$this->Crud->on('beforeDelete', function(\Cake\Event\Event $event) {
			// Stop the delete event, the entity will not be deleted
			if ($event->subject->item->author !== 'admin') {
				$event->stopPropagation();
			}
		});

		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}
