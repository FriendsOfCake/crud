Crud.beforeBulk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This event is emitted before ``_bulk()`` is called on a Bulk Crud action.

The :ref:`Crud Subject <crud-subject>` contains the following keys:

- **ids** A list of ids of entities, from the request data
- **repository** An instance of the ``Repository`` (``Table``) which the query will be executed against.
- **query** A ``Query`` object from the ``Repository`` where ``$PrimaryKey => $IdFromRequest`` is already added to the conditions.

To abort a bulk action, simply stop the event by calling
``$event->stopPropagation()``.
