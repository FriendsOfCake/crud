Crud.afterFind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the query has been executed, and a record has been found this event is emitted.

The :ref:`Crud Subject <crud-subject>` contains two keys:

- ``id`` The ID that was originally passed to the action and is usually the primary key of your model.
- ``item`` The record that was found in the database.

.. note::

	If an entity is not found, the ``RecordNotFound`` event is emitted instead.

Logging the Found Item
----------------------

.. code-block:: phpinline

	public function delete($id) {
		$this->Crud->on('afterFind', function(\Cake\Event\Event $event) {
			$this->log("Found item: $event->subject->item->id in the database");
		});

		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}
