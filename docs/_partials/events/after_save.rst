Crud.afterSave
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

	Do not confuse this event with the ``afterSave`` callback in the ORM layer.

This event is emitted right after the call to ``Table::save()``.

The :ref:`Crud Subject <crud-subject>` contains the following keys:

- **id** The newly inserted ID. It's only available if the call to ``Table::save()`` was successful.
- **success** indicates whether or not the ``Table::save()`` call succeed or not.
- **created** ``true`` if the record was ``created`` and ``false`` if the record was ``updated``.
- **item** An ``entity`` object marshaled with the ``HTTP POST`` data from the request and the ``save()`` logic.

Check Created Status
--------------------

.. code-block:: phpinline

	public function edit($id) {
		$this->Crud->on('afterSave', function(\Cake\Event\Event $event) {
			if ($event->subject->created) {
				$this->log("The entity was created");
			} else {
				$this->log("The entity was updated");
			}
		});

		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}

Check Success Status
--------------------

.. code-block:: phpinline

	public function edit($id) {
		$this->Crud->on('afterSave', function(\Cake\Event\Event $event) {
			if ($event->subject->success) {
				$this->log("The entity was saved successfully");
			} else {
				$this->log("The entity was NOT saved successfully");
			}
		});

		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}

Get Entity ID
-------------

.. code-block:: phpinline

	public function add() {
		$this->Crud->on('afterSave', function(\Cake\Event\Event $event) {
		if ($event->subject->created) {
				$this->log("The entity was created with id: $event->subject->id");
			}
		});

		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}
