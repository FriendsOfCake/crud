# Api Listener

This listener allows you to easily create a JSON or XML Api build on top of Crud.

# Setup

The Api listener depends on the `RequestHandler` to be loaded __before__ `Crud`

[Please also see the CakePHP documentation on JSON and XML views](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/views/json-and-xml-views.html#enabling-data-views-in-your-application)

## Router

You need to tell the `Router` to parse extensions else it won't be able to process and render the
`json` and `xml` URL extension

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// app/Config/routes.php
Router::setExtensions(array('json', 'xml'));
Router::parseExtensions();
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Attach it on the fly in your controller `beforeFilter`

This is recommended if you want to attach it only to specific controllers and actions

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class SamplesController extends AppController {

  public function beforeFilter() {
    parent::beforeFilter();
    $this->Crud->addListener('Api');
  }

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Attach it using components array

This is recommended if you want to attach it to all controllers, application wide

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class SamplesController extends AppController {

  public $components = [
    'RequestHandler',
    'Crud.Crud' => [
      'actions' => ['index', 'view'],
      'listeners' => ['Api']
    ]
  ];

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

# New CakeRequest detectors

The Api Listener creates 3 new detectors in your `CakeRequest` object.

## is('json')

Checks if the extension of the request is '.json' or if the requester accepts json as part of the
`HTTP accepts` header

## is('xml')

Checks if the extension of the request is '.xml' or if the requester accepts XML as part of the
`HTTP accepts` header

## is('api')

Checking if the request is either `is('json')` or `is('xml')`

# Default behavior

If the current request doesn't evaluate `is('api')` to true, the listener won't do anything at all.
All it's callbacks will simply return NULL and don't get in your way.

# Exception handler

The Api listener overrides the `Exception.renderer` for `api` requests, so in case of an error, a
standardized error will be returned, in either `json` or `xml` - according to the API request type.

# Custom view classes

By default the Api Listener will override the `RequestHandler` viewClass for `json` and `xml`

For `xml` the `Crud.CrudXml` view class will be used, and for `json` the `Crud.CrudJson` view will be used.

These view classes currently doesn't provide any unique functionality to the View, other than [backporting
a view alias feature](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/1405) from CakePHP 2.4 to earlier versions.

You can call [injectViewClasses]({{site.url}}/api/develop/class-ApiListener.html#_injectViewClasses) manually to
inject these views into the RequestHandler if you don't need the full ApiListener class or functionality.

Use [viewClass]({{site.url}}/api/develop/class-ApiListener.html#_viewClass) to read or change the mapping
between a response type and it's view class.

# Request type enforcing

The Api listener will try to enforce some best practices on how an API should behave.

For a request to `index`, `view`, `admin_index` or `admin_view` the HTTP request type __must__ be
`HTTP GET` - else an `MethodNotAllowed` exception will be raised.

For a request to `add`, `admin_add` the HTTP request type __must__ be `HTTP POST` - else an
`MethodNotAllowed` exception will be raised.

For a request to `edit`, `admin_edit` the HTTP request type __must__ be `HTTP PUT` - else an
`MethodNotAllowed` exception will be raised.

For a request to `delete`, `admin_delete` the HTTP request type __must__ be `HTTP DELETE` - else an
`MethodNotAllowed` exception will be raised.

# Making your application API only

Using the `ApiListener` it's fairly easy to make your application only a REST API without the
possibility to access other pages. Without any views they will trigger `HTTP 500` errors. To make
your application API only, add the following code to your `AppController::beforeFilter()`:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
public function beforeFilter() {
  if (!$this->request->is('api')) {
    throw new NotFoundException();
  }
  parent::beforeFilter();
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure the `ApiListener` is added before that is executed though. All request that aren't meant for the API will now throw a `HTTP 404` error instead.

# Response format

The default response format for both XML and JSON is two root keys, `success` and `data`

It's possible to add your root keys simply by [expanding on the cakephp](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/views/json-and-xml-views.html#enabling-data-views-in-your-application)
`_serialize` key

## JSON

{% highlight json %}
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

## XML

{% highlight xml %}
<response>
  <success>1</success>
  <data></data>
</response>
{% endhighlight %}

## Exception response format

The `data.exception` key is only returned if `debug` is > 0

The `data.queryLog` key is only included if `debug` is > 1

### JSON

{% highlight json %}
{
  "success": false,
  "data": {
    "code": 500,
    "url": "/some/url.json",
    "name": "Some exception message",
    "exception": {
      "class": "CakeException",
      "code": 500,
      "message": "Some exception message",
      "trace": []
    },
    "queryLog": [ ]
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### XML

{% highlight xml %}
<response>
  <success>0</success>
  <data>
    <code>500</code>
    <url>/some/url.json</url>
    <name>Some exception message</name>
    <exception>
      <class>CakeException</class>
      <code>500</code>
      <message>Some exception message</message>
      <trace></trace>
      <trace></trace>
    </exception>
    <queryLog/>
  </data>
</response>
{% endhighlight %}

## HTTP POST / PUT (add / edit)

`success` is based on the `event->subject->success` parameter from `Add` or `Edit` action

If `success` is `false` a HTTP response code of `400` will be returned, and the `data` property will
be the list of validation errors from the model.

If `success` is `true` a HTTP response code of `201` will be returned if the model item was
__created__ else a `301` response code will be used.

A success will always include a HTTP `Location` header to the `view` action with the existing or
newly created id of the record

## HTTP DELETE (delete)

`success` is based on the `event->subject->success` parameter from the `delete`action

`data` will always be `null`

No special HTTP codes is sent

## Not Found (view / edit / delete)

In case an `id` is provided to a crud action and the id does not exist in the database, a `404`
`NotFoundException` will be thrown

## Invalid id (view / edit / delete)

In case a `Ã¬d` is provided to a crud action and the id is not valid according to the database type
a `500` `BadRequestException` will be thrown
