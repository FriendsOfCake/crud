Introduction
============

Crud was built to be http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/controllers/scaffolding.html on steroids, and allow developers to have enough flexibility to use it for both rapid prototyping and production applications, even on the same code base -- saving you time.

* Crud is :doc:`very fast to install</installation>`, a few minutes tops.

* Crud is very flexible and has tons of :doc:`configuration options</configuration>`.

* Crud aims to stay out of your way, and if it happens to get in your way, you can change the undesired behavior very easily.

* Crud relies heavily on CakePHP events making it possible to override, extend, or disable almost all of Crud's functionality either globally or for one specific action.

* Usually, the basic code for controller CRUD actions is very simple and always looks the same. Crud will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to reimplement them over and over again.

* Crud does not have the same limitations as CakePHP's own scaffolding, which is "my way or the highway." Crud allows you to hook into all stages of a request, only building the controller code needed specifically for your business logic, outsourcing all the heavy boilerplating to Crud.

* Less boilerplate code means less code to maintain, and less code to spend time unit testing.

* Crud allows you to use your own views, baked or hand-crafted, in addition to adding the code needed to fulfill your application logic, using :doc:`events<events>`. It is by default compatible with CakePHP's baked views.

* Crud also provides built in features for JSON and XML :doc:`APIs<listener/api>` for any action you have enabled through Crud, which eliminates maintaining both a HTML frontend and a JSON and/or XML interface for your applications -- saving you tons of time and having a leaner code base.
