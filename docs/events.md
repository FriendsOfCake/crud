# Crud actions and their events

All Crud events always return `NULL`, any modifications should be done to the CrudEventSubject
object (`$event->subject`)

All Crud events take exactly one parameter, `CakeEvent $event`

For a list of emitted events, please see the [configuration documentation]({{site.url}}/docs/configuration.html)

## Global accessible subject properties

The `$subject` object can be accessed through `$event->subject` in all event callbacks

# Callbacks in the controller

In all these examples there is a call to `parent::` in `beforeFilter` at the end of the method -
it is highly recommended to remember to include this.

The `Crud->on()` method accepts anything that `is_callable` evaluate to true.

## Lambda / Closure in beforeFilter()

This is convenient for for very simple callbacks, or for callbacks shared between multiple actions

It's recommended to add your callbacks to controller action they need to be used in, as it makes the
controller code much more coherent and easier to debug

Don't put too many lines of logic in a closure callback as it quickly gets messy, and it's very hard
to unit test the isolated behavior of the callback.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class DemoController extends AppController {

	public function beforeFilter() {
		$this->Crud->on('beforePaginate', function(CakeEvent $event) {
			$event->subject->query['conditions'] = array('is_active' => true);
			debug($event->subject->query);
		});

		parent::beforeFilter();
	}

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Method inside the controller

Very much like the `Closure` example above, except the callback code is in a method of its own, that
can be unit tested easier.

The method __must be public__, since it's called from outside the scope of the controller.

__Pro tip__: Prefix your callbacks with `_` and CakePHP will prevent the method to be called through
the web.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class DemoController extends AppController {

	public function beforeFilter() {
		$this->Crud->on('beforePaginate', array($this, '_demoCallback'));

		parent::beforeFilter();
	}

	public function _demoCallback(CakeEvent $event) {
		$event->subject->query['conditions']['is_active'] = true;
		debug($event->subject->query);
	}

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Overriding implementedEvents() in the controller

You can override the `implementedEvents` method inside the controller and provide a list of `event => callback` for Crud.

The key is the Crud event name (Remember all events need the `Crud.` prefix) and the value is the
name of the method in your controller that should be executed.

The method __must be public__, since it's called from outside the scope of the controller.

__Pro tip__: Prefix your callbacks with `_` and CakePHP will prevent the method to be called through
the web.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
public function implementedEvents() {
	return parent::implementedEvents() + array(
		'Crud.beforeFind' => '_beforeFind',
		'Crud.beforeSave' => '_beforeSave',
	);
}

public function _beforeFind(CakeEvent $event) {

}

public function _beforeSave(CakeEvent $event) {

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Lambda / Closure inside a specific controller action

Very much like the other `Closure` examples above.

When implementing callbacks inside the controller action, it's very important to call the
`execute` in `Crud`.

This will allow Crud to continue to do it's magic just as if the method didn't exist at all in the
controller in the first place.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class DemoController extends AppController {

	public function view($id = null) {
		$this->Crud->on('beforeFind', function(CakeEvent $event) use ($id) {
			$event->subject->query['conditions']['is_active'] = true;
		}

		// Important for the ViewCrudAction to be executed
		return $this->Crud->execute();
	}

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## CrudListener classes

You can attach custom listener classes by simply passing them to the normal
controller `EventManager`

Creating custom listener classes is documented in the [custom listeners]({{site.url}}/docs/listeners/custom.html)
section

{% highlight php %}
<?php
App::uses('DemoListener', 'Controller/Crud/Listener');

class DemoController extends AppController {

	public function beforeFilter() {
		$this->getEventManager()->attach(new DemoListener());
		parent::beforeFilter();
	}

}
?>
{% endhighlight %}
