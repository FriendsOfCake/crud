## Language

All of the messages used in the crud component can be overridden in one of two ways: by explicitly defining the messages
to use in the controller's components array, or by using the standard translations functions of CakePHP.

### Overriding individual messages

The below components array is populated with all of the messages used:

```php
<?php
class DemoController extends AppController {

/**
 * List of global controller components
 *
 * @cakephp
 * @var array
 */
	public $components = array(
		// Enable CRUD actions
		'Crud.Crud' => array(
			'actions' => array('index', 'add', 'edit', 'view', 'delete'),
			'translations' => array(
				'domain' => 'crud',
				'name' => null,
				'create' => array(
					'success' => array(
						'message' => 'Successfully created {name}',
						'element' => 'success'
					),
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Could not create {name}',
						'element' => 'error'
					)
				),
				'update' => array(
					'success' => array(
						'message' => '{name} was successfully updated',
						'element' => 'success'
					),
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Could not update {name}',
						'element' => 'error'
					)
				),
				'delete' => array(
					'success' => array(
						'message' => 'Successfully deleted {name}',
						'element' => 'success'
					),
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Could not delete {name}',
						'element' => 'error'
					)
				),
				'find' => array(
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Could not find {name}',
						'element' => 'error'
					)
				),
				'invalid_http_request' => array(
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Invalid HTTP request',
						'element' => 'error'
					),
				),
				'invalid_id' => array(
					'error' => array(
						'message' => 'Invalid id',
						'element' => 'error'
					)
				)
			)
		)
	);
}
```

The `Crud.Crud.translations.name` key, if defined, overrides the model's name property, and is
used to replace the `{name}` placeholder in the messages for each CRUD action. If it is not set,
the model's name property is used.

### Using translations

The strings indicated in the above code block are converted to complete sententces and then passed
through Cake's translate functions](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/internationalization-and-localization.html).
By default, the translation domain `crud` is used in translations, this can be overriden by setting the domain to a different
value in the components poperty.

For convenience, a shell is provided to generate full-sentence translation calls to permit [Cake's I18n
shell](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/console-and-shells/i18n-shell.html)
to extract them

```sh
$ Console/cake Crud.translations generate
---------------------------------------------------------------
Generating translation strings for models: Post

Adding: Invalid HTTP request
Adding: Invalid id
Adding: Successfully created Post
Adding: Could not create Post
Adding: Post was successfully updated
Adding: Could not update Post
Adding: Successfully deleted Post
Adding: Could not delete Post
Adding: Could not find Post
app/Config/i18n_crud.php updated
---------------------------------------------------------------
$
```

The contents of the file `app/Config/i18n_crud.php` is only calls to the translate function:

```php
<?php

/**
 * Common CRUD Component translations
 */
__d('crud', 'Invalid HTTP request');
__d('crud', 'Invalid id');

/**
 * Post CRUD Component translations
 */
__d('crud', 'Successfully created Post');
__d('crud', 'Could not create Post');
__d('crud', 'Post was successfully updated');
__d('crud', 'Could not update Post');
__d('crud', 'Successfully deleted Post');
__d('crud', 'Could not delete Post');
__d('crud', 'Could not find Post');
```

This file provides static calls of all permutations of the messages that the component could use for the App's
models. To generate the calls for a plugin's models - pass the path to the plugin as an argument:

```sh
$ Console/cake Crud.translations generate Plugin/Foo
---------------------------------------------------------------
Generating translation strings for models: Foo

Adding: Invalid HTTP request
Adding: Invalid id
Adding: Successfully created Foo
Adding: Could not create Foo
Adding: Foo was successfully updated
Adding: Could not update Foo
Adding: Successfully deleted Foo
Adding: Could not delete Foo
Adding: Could not find Foo
app/Config/i18n_crud.php updated
---------------------------------------------------------------
$
```

In the same way you can define/add the translations for an individual model.

The config file generated by this shell is not loaded at run time, it's purpose is purely to provide fixed-string translations
for the extract task to be able to identify the sentences used in the crud plugin. It's recommended to add this file to your
application's code repository.
